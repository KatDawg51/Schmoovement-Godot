# Schmoovement-Godot

### Copy and Pasted from [here:](https://forum.godotengine.org/t/3d-schmovement-system-showcase/97992/2)

I made this little movement system based on: Untitled Tag Game (Roblox), and Bad Business (Roblox).

It has:
1. Robust Vaulting System
2. Acceleration and Deceleration
3. 3D GPU Particle Speed Streaks 
4. Test Map
5. Smooth Head Bob
6. FOV alterations based on speed
7. Jumping with Height and Distance Based on Speed
8. Jump buffer
9. Coyote Time
10. Horizontal Velocity Speedometer (Bottom Left)
11. Separate Strafe Speeds (Hardcoded)
13. Too many export vars
14. Horribly written code that I'll try to fix eventually
15. And last but not least a cry for help
