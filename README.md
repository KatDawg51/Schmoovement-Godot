## Schmoovement-Godot


# Copy and Pasted from: https://forum.godotengine.org/

I made this little movement system based on: Untitled Tag Game (Roblox), and Bad Business (Roblox).

It has:
1. A robust vaulting system
2. Acceleration and deceleration
3. Speed streaks
4. A test map
5. Jumping with height and a boost based on speed
6. A horizontal speedometer 
7. Separate strafe speeds (Hardcoded)
8. Too many export vars
9. Horribly written code that Ill try to fix eventually
10. And last but not least a cry for help

The repository is public and opensource, so you can use it however you want.
If you end up adding nice features/fixes to your version, it would be nice if you added a pull request for my branch <3.

This is my first repository, so if you find any issues DM me or make a issue report, or whatever github calls it!
