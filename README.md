### Copy and Pasted from [here:](https://forum.godotengine.org/t/3d-schmovement-system-showcase/97992/2)

I made this little movement system based on: Untitled Tag Game (Roblox), and Bad Business (Roblox).

Features:
1. A robust vaulting system
2. Acceleration and deceleration
4. Test map (updated)
5. Smooth head bob
6. FOV alterations based on speed
7. Jumping with height and distance based on speed
8. Jump buffer
9. Coyote time
10. Horizontal velocity speedometer (bottom left)
11. Sprinting and autosprinting
12. Jump cooldown
